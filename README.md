# multidimensional_age_prediction

1. run quadratic regression on brain features with age, age^2, sex, age*sex, and age^2*sex
2. run cluster based on the coefficients in the regression model.
3. build age prediction model for each cluster identified in the previous stage.
4. examine how the predicted age (brain age), and brain age gap (chronological age - brain age) is associated with behavioral performance and disorder
