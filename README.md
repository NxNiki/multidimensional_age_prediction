# multidimensional_age_prediction

# first run quadratic regression on brain features with age, age^2, sex, age*sex, and age^2*sex
# then run cluster based on the coefficients in the regression model.
# then build age prediction model for each cluster identified in the previous stage.
# then examine how the predicted age (brain age), and brain age gap (chronological age - brain age) is associated with behavioral performance
