This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

beta2 = seq(0, 2, length.out = 10)
rsquared = rep(NA, 10)

for (i in 1:length(beta2)){
    beta = rbind(1, .5, beta2[i])
  set.seed(111)
  x = rnorm(100)
  X_mat = cbind(rep(1,100), x, x^2)
  set.seed(222)
  y =  X_mat %*% beta + rnorm(100, sd = .5)
  #y =  X_mat %*% beta
  
  
  #plot(x,y)
  
  rsquared[i] = summary(lm(y~X_mat))$r.squared
  
}

plot(beta2, rsquared)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
